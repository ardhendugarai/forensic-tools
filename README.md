# Forensic Tools

A collection of penetration testing, analytics, and forensic tools that I wrote in summer 2016.

## Disk Analyzer

Queries multiple tools such as VirusTotal, WildFire, ClamAV, and NSRL to perform deep analysis on a forensic disk image.

## Tor Web Crawler

Connects to the Tor network and does web scraping for email addresses. Follows links on webpages so it can quickly find data for a specific domain.

## dnmap

Uses AWS instances to spin up a master-slave dnmap implementation. Uses distributed port scanning for load-balancing and covert reconnaissance.
